                <h2> A City That Breathes Music</h2>
                <p>
                    With over 200 live music venues, Melbourne is often
                    celebrated as Australia's cultural capital, and

                    music scene being one of it's most defining features.
                    With it's abudance of live venues, rich
                    diversity of genres,
                    and deep-rooted history, Melbourne earned it's
                    reputation as a true musical city. Festivals, live
                    music venues,
                    government support are some of the factors that make
                    Melbourne so culturally relevant and truly
                    vibrant core
                    for music lovers, musicians, and industry professional
                    alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Melbourne has a vibrant and diverse music scene, also reflected in the the diverse amount
                    of venues <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>, that
                    includes genres going from rock and pop to jazz
                    and classical.
                    Venues like the iconic Forum Theatre and AAMI Park host
                    both local and international artists. The
                    city's
                    vibrant street music scene is another testament to
                    Melbourne's love for music. In areas like Bourke
                    Street
                    Mall and Southbank, talented buskers create an open-air
                    festival-like atmosphere, enhancing the
                    city's cultural fabric.

                <p>
                    Besides the venues, Melbourne has a vast amount of music
                    festivals and cultural events, such as the
                    Melbourne
                    International Jazz Festival, St Kilda Festival, and the
                    Melbourne Music Week.
                    These festivals gather visitors from all around the
                    world thus contributing to the vibrant music
                    culture of the
                    city. A recent study, named <a

                    providing a very interesting look into recent years and

                <p>
                    This would not be possible if Melbourne didn't have the
                    ideal cultural and economical environment to
                    achivieve it.
                    Melbourne has developed a supportive community of musicians,
                    promoters, and industry professionals who
                    work together to foster
                    emerging talent. The city provides resources like
                    government grants, workshops, and educational
                    programs to nurture
                    upcoming artists.

                    From bars to universities, Melbourne has the proper
                    infra-structure to support a lively and growing

                </p>

                <h2> Melbourne as a Culture </h2>
                <p>
                    Widely recognized as Australia's cultural capital, Melbourne is a city where creativity is alive and
                    diversity is celebrated. Its
                    cultural hubs are a reflection of this, and so, providing a vibrant mix of art, music, and heritage
                    that defines the
                    city's unique character. Looking into the other establishments in the city has to
                    offer, its clear that Melbourne is a city that is friendly for tourists. The red markings show
                    places of assembly, such as theaters and museums.

                <p>
                    Moving away from Melbourne as a Music City, Melbourne is also home to a diverse range of theaters
                    and performance spaces. The iconic Princess Theatre and the Arts
                    Centre Melbourne are hubs for world-class theater productions, while independent spaces like the
                    Malthouse Theatre
                    nurture experimental and contemporary performances. This theatrical diversity fosters a rich
                    creative landscape,
                    allowing both local and international talent to flourish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) and the Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) are
                    just a couple of the city's prominent art institutions. These spaces, located within the cultural
                    hub of Federation Square, act as beacons for the city's thriving artistic community. Alongside these
                    major institutions, numerous galleries and street art-laden laneways showcase Melbourne's dynamic
                    visual arts scene.

                    Nonetheless, when analysing what makes Melbourne so interesting to visit, it doesn't boil down only
                    to arts and music. Although
                    these are two major factors into the city's cultural hubs, it's a combination of architecture,
                    tranportation system, religious and historical
                    influences and spaces dedicated for assembly and community usage that really allow for Melbourne to
                    flourish. As we can notice in
                    <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>, it's an entire infrastructure that aids the stability and
                    sustainable of community life in the city, which is
                    directly translated to not only art and music but also directly to the people's well-being.
                </p>
                <h2> The Community</h2>

                    Understanding a city's job market provides valuable insights into its economic landscape. In 2022,

                <h2> Melbourne's Accessibility</h2>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we wanted to understand how the city's parking is planned and shaped around Melbourne's
                    cultural hubs. Being a
                    car-oriented city and the most populous city in Australia, Melbourne faces significant challenges
                    related to its growing
                    population and traffic congestion. A recent <a

                <p>
                    Our analysis aims to explore the impact of parking infrastructure on Melbourne's cultural areas
                    without delving into the
                    broader traffic congestion issue or proposing solutions to it.
                    Instead, we wanted to analyse what is the current accessibility around our live music venues and
                    landmarks.
                    Parking, often considered merely a logistical concern, plays a significant role in shaping the
                    cultural dynamics of
                    cities, including Melbourne. Both off-street and on-street parking influence how people interact
                    with urban spaces and
                    the cultural fabric of the city.

                <p>
                    As we can see in <a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a>, Melbourne's has a high concentration of on-street
                    parking available revolved around main cultural areas.
                    These parking hubs also reflect some of the city's cultural hub both landmark and music venues wise,
                    such as Melbourne Central and South Bank.
                    On-street parking provides convenient access to businesses, venues, and public spaces, encouraging
                    foot traffic and
                    fostering a vibrant street life. This ease of access helps support local shops, restaurants, and
                    cultural venues by
                    making them more accessible to residents and visitors.

                <p>
                    Nevertheless, in a city, specially a car-oriented city, off-street parking often complements the
                    availability of on-street parking.
                    However, off-street parking has greater impact than what most people would figure. Off-street
                    parking facilities, such as parking garages and lots,
                    not only support economic activity by providing centralized parking solutions for larger venues,
                    shopping centers, and entertainment districts but also
                    is essential for major cultural events, concerts, and festivals. Large-capacity parking facilities
                    ensure smooth traffic
                    flow, enhancing the visitor experience and allowing events to attract larger crowds. This way,
                    off-street parking enables visitors
                    to spend extended time in cultural districts without worrying about parking availability. Melbourne
                    offers a great deal of off-street parking
                    that also support the main cultural hubs and give a more stress free access to landmarks and venues
                    as seen in <a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>,
                    creating a excellent pedestrian environment and showing a shift towards sustainable urban planning
                    and walkable cities.
