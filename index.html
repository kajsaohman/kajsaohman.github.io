                    and Insurance services and Professional, Scientific and Technical services. Melbourne is home for

                <p>
                    It is also worth noting that there is an industry for mining in the city, one of the largest mining
                    companies in the world, BHP Billiton mining, is in Melbourne.

                    Regarding the cultural scene in Melbourne, titled the biggest city for live music venues, the
                    industry for Arts and recreation services has grown for the past 10 years. It's not for nothing the
